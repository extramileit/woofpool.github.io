                            This is a place where

                <p>WOOF Pool will make donations on a monthly basis provided the pool produces
                    blocks in the
                    preceding 30 days, i.e. every six epochs.
                    The charities will be be rotated after each 30 day period.
                </p>
                <p>Proof of donations by the pool will be provided on this website.</p>
                <p>
                    As a long-term goal, WOOF pool will reach out to the organization to consider receiving ADA
                    directly
                    or by using a payment gateway like <a href="https://adapay.finance/" target="_blank">ADA Pay</a>, so
                    that it eliminates the need to convert donations into fiat
                    money.
                    This will help expand the Cardano ecosystem to more organizations and promote awareness.

                    <p>
                        I am Kurt, an IT professional with over twenty years of software development experience as a
                        consultant based in the United States. I appreciate the impact of blockchain technologies and
                        believe
                        Cardano is poised to change the world for the better.
                        I have been learning about digital currencies and blockchain projects since 2017.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In addition to running WOOF pool, I am working to build distributed applications (DApps) on
                        Cardano.
                        Over the last few months, I have been learning the Haskell programming language, which is the
                        language used by Cardano for smart contract development.
                        I aim to give back to the community by producing educational videos and documentation about the
                        things I learn in the process.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My wife and I love animals, and we have two dogs named Zola and Tark.
                        Our dogs bring so much joy to our lives. But, there are so many pets that are abandoned
                        or have been mistreated and need care & shelter. This pool will provide important financial
                        resources to the
                        organizations that provide care to the animals in need.
                        Once the pool starts making donations, I plan to add a blog to this website to provide updates
                        on the charities.

                <h4 class="mt-4" style="color: #bf692c;">What does the pool run on?</h4>
                <p>
                    The pool is run on three virtual private servers (VPS) including one block producer and
                    two relays.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Each VPS is running Ubuntu 20.04 operating system with 8 CPU cores, 30 GB of RAM, and 800 gigabytes of SSD storage
                    to accommodate growing network usage.
                </p>

            <div>
                <h4 class="mt-4" style="color: #bf692c;">How will the pool be maintained?</h4>
                <p>
                    This pool is monitored to ensure 24 x 7 access. The monitoring process collects statistics about the
                    health of the operating system as well
                    as the state of the Cardano block chain. If the state of the system shows any concerns such as the
                    Cardano node not connecting to peers, notifications are sent to the operator to promptly fix the issue.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Your pool operator will maintain the appropriate Cardano node software at all times
                    and follow best-practice security recommendations to ensure the pool maintains high availability.

                <h4 class="mt-4" style="color: #bf692c;">Why Cardano?</h4>
                <img style="float:left;margin-right: 30px;" src="images/teacherDog.jpg" height="216" width="324"/>
                <p>
                    One of the biggest differentiators of Cardano from other blockchains is their philosophy towards
                    designing the protocols used by the network. Cardano relies on the standards of science.
                    IOHK, the company which founded Cardano, recruits domain experts and professors from
                    computer programming, network design, and cryptography to research
                    problems and design solutions. Based on the research, they write academic papers and present
                    them at
                    computing conferences for peer review. This research and peer-review
                    process leads to better design, and it also promotes shared understanding with the
                    broader community in the cryptography/blockchain space.
                    Because of this rigor, Cardano may be slower to market than other blockchain projects,
                    but it also means that Cardano will deliver solutions that are more robust and
                    with less unforeseen issues as compared to other projects.

                    Perhaps, you are new to Cardano or you just need some help learning how to stake your ADA.
                    Fortunately, there are some nice YouTube Videos on this. Here is one to get you started, but
                    it's easy to find great tutorials on this by searching in YouTube. Of course, it would be wonderful
                    if you stake with WOOF Pool!
