                <p>
                    We are a Cardano stake pool that is dedicated to the well-being of abandoned animals.
                    Half of the profits, i.e. 50% of margin, generated by this pool will be donated to charities that can make a huge difference in the
                    lives of animals. The donations will go mainly to shelter and rescue operations, but we welcome
                    suggestions for charities from you. See the list of curated charities below.
                    Please contact us with your suggested charity.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Each year, millions of companion pets are surrendered to a shelter and many are euthanized. Animals
                    have no voice of their own, no social safety net and very few rights under the law.
                    Shelters and rescue operations for pets need donations from the community to operate. Many animal
                    shelters do not have the resources they need to care for sick or injured animals.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Animal shelters need food, bedding and other supplies. Many need veterinarian care, medical assistance and spaying/neutering.
                    Your donations will help provide the care abandoned animals need until a suitable home is found for them.
                    Together, we can make a HUGE difference.

                <p>
                    I am Kurt, an IT professional with over twenty years of software development experience in the IT
                    business based in the United States. I appreciate the impact of blockchain technologies and believe
                    Cardano is poised to change the world for the better.
                    I will also be working on DApp development to help grow the Cardano
                    eco-system. I aim to give back to the community by producing educational videos about the things I
                    learn in the process.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My wife and I are dog lovers, and we have two labradors named Zola and Tark. We were each
                    volunteers at a local animal humane society office before life got too busy.
                </p>

                        The pool is run off three reliable, redundant virtual private servers, one block producer and

                    <li>
                        All nodes run on Ubuntu linux 20.04 with ample hardware resources to accommodate growing network
                        usage
                    </li>
